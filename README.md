## _convenient Skyrim console commands without having to google them_

Skyrim EZ Console is a program that allows users to search console commands for Skyrim without needing to do variety research and memorize console commands.

- Quickly accessible (it's really handy when paired with, say, the Steam overlay..)
- Don't need to memorize console commands (quick stat changes can be copy-pasted, other commands are also displayed)
- Can be useful for testing or quickly making a build without going through the whole game

I expect there's going to be a few bugs here and there.
And some UI elements that don't look particularly awesome.
I do plan on giving it a few last finishing touches and some quality of life changes.
Along with instructions on how to use this.

### HOW TO USE: (instructions also appear in the app)
  First, install <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/79975">ConsolePlusPlus</a> for Skyrim Special Edition using your favorite mod loader.
  Then open this application (at https://donwung.github.io/Skyrim-EZ-Console/)
  
  To set your skills, click on the skill name to enable changes.
  
  Then drag the slider as desired.

  To set your perks, mouse over the "View Perks" text to open the perks selection menu.
  
  If the perk has a slider, you can select your desired rank.
  
  Then you can click the "+" button to add the perk to your list of console commands.

  When finished, you can mouse over the bottom part of the window.
  
  Then click the "console" to enlarge it.
  
  Here, you can see your skills and perks selected.
  
  To remove a console command, click the "(remove)" button.

  You can then click "Copy to Clipboard" to copy all the commands to your clipboard.
  
  Then go back into your game, open the Skyrim console using "`" (the key under Esc),
  
  (alternatively, manually select the text then copy it using Ctrl+C)
  
  then paste your command using Ctrl+V.
  
  Paste into Skyrim (line breaks are hidden in the in-game console, so CTRL+V just once is good)

# Skyrim EZ Console
## _convenient Skyrim console commands without having to google them_

Skyrim Console Commander is a program that allows users to search console commands for Skyrim without needing to do variety research and memorize console commands.

- Quickly accessible (it's really handy when paired with, say, the Steam overlay..)
- Don't need to memorize console commands (quick stat changes can be copy-pasted, other commands are also displayed)
- Can be useful for testing or quickly making a build without going through the whole game

I expect there's going to be a few bugs here and there.
And some UI elements that don't look particularly awesome.
I do plan on giving it a few last finishing touches and some quality of life changes.
Along with instructions on how to use this.

### HOW TO USE:
<!-- Included on the application, there will be a hoverable section that will detail how to use the tool.
Such as:

- where to download Skyrim Copy-Paste
- how to navigate the UI
- how to enable console
- etc -->
- Download ConsolePlusPlus and install it
- Select the console commands in the output box, then copy
- Paste into Skyrim (line breaks are hidden in the in-game console, so CTRL+V just once is good)

### TO BE ADDED:

- remove a perk
- add instructions to webpage
- links to UESP
- increase browser support
- copy to clipboard

### INPUT:
User can select from a few commonly used console commands such as:

- change stat
- add item (to be added)
- add perks
- among other things (mini help menu with extraneous commands)

### OUTPUT:
User opens up the console drop-up box and copies the commands to paste them into Skyrim
